# Unit Tests

Apply these rules to all `*.test.js`, `*.test.ts`, `*.test.jsx`, `*.test.tsx` files.

## Test Best Practices

- Test behavior, not implementation
- Focus on critical paths over 100% coverage
- Each test should run independently without shared state
- Clean up after tests (afterEach/afterAll when needed)
