# Project Context

- **Package manager**: Bun only. Use `bun` and `bunx`, never npm/yarn.
- **Path alias**: `@` resolves to `./src` — use `@/components/...`, `@/lib/...` in imports.
- **Stack**: React 19 + Vite 6, Radix Themes, CSS Modules, design tokens in `src/styles/tokens.css`.
- **Commits**: English, Conventional Commits with scope. Use `bun run commit`.
